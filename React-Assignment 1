2)Difference between library and framework?
Both of these are resuable codes written by someone else to solve some common problems.

A library used to target specific parts of application, we can use when or where ever we need it in the application. Library is a set of objects and functions which help in solving particular problem.

A framework is a blueprint or architecture using which we can develop whole application from scratch. A framework is set of libraries which covers all areas of application development.

7) What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN ?
In development mode we get all the development tools and debugging tools to develop and debug our application.

In production mode, our code is compressed and lot of functionalties we not present to improve the performance and speed in the production mode.

8) What are async and defer in script tags?

When our browser starts HTML parsing and  it stops when it come across script files. It fetches script files , executes script file and the continue rest of HTML Parsing again. Here scripts are blocking rendering of html, which is not a good case.


async: when we use async script tag, our project starts HTML parsing and parallely starts fetching script files, after fetching, it stops HTML parsing and starts executing script files. When done executing script files it starts Parsing HTML again.

defer : When we use defer in scripts, our browser starts HTML Parsing and parallely fetches scripts files, but executes script files only when the entire HTML Parsing in completed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9) When to use async and defer?

If our program has lot of script files, if the order of their execution doesnt matter we can use async .

but if we have lot of script files and they are dependant on each other and their order of execution, we should use defer.
